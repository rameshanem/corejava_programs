why do we need abstarct class and interface
============================================
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
abstract is a keyword which we can apply for the methods, class , virable as well
abstarct calss contains bth abstarct methodds and concreate or fully implemented ,ethods as well
to wtrite abstarct classs we need abstarct key oword or modifer
abstarct class can also contain contrcutor
we cant create an object for the absatrct class
by extedning abstarct class from base calss we can craete objecta nd access all the methods from abtastc class
Constructor is allowd in abstract & Constructor we cant allowed interface
abstarct class can have four type of avrable sattaic , non satic final non final

absatrct calss can have multiple concrete methods and also multiple absatrct methods
abstarct class AbstarctExample{
AbstarctExample(){

}
 //fullimpe,mthtd
 void printMethod(){


 }
 absatrct void printMethod();

}
