interface
==========
by using inetrfce we can achive fully abstartion concept
inside interface we dont ahve any implemntation methods but from 8 onwards introdcued default and sattic methods
what...?
inetrfce is as key word using this we can create n numebr of interfaces not the clasess

inetrface by defaul all are public abastrct methods only
we cant craete object for the interface 
interface doesnt ahve constructor as well
inside interface all are sattic and final varbles taht means interface not allowed insatnce bvarbles like of class

one interface can exetend multipleinterfces but one interface cant be implemnts other interface
since we can extends multiple interfces we can say it is allowing multiple inheritance concept
implemts keyword applciable for the clasess
we can use impe,kmnt keword from class to other interfcae

Wehen ever your calss impemnts other interface then all the abstarct methods should override in the implemnttion calss

calss C extedns B,A //not avlida
inteface C extedns B,A //valid
